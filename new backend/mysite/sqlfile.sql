Students meet in small sections to have class discussions and debates about questions like: What are minds? Are minds physical or non-physical? Do humans have free will? Does reliance on technology turn humans into cyborgs? How close are humans to building an intelligent robot or machine? Do we want this to be a goal? Students will learn how make a philosophical argument, and how to express them in writing or through an oral presentation.	1	0	0	1	1	0	{"Artificial Intelligence"}

230	STSS	2700	Law and Society	There ought to be a law…”  Law shapes people’s lives in countless ways; it is everywhere. Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimizes, protects, and prosecutes. Law is more than the written word, the “black letter law.” People make the law—judges, attorneys, police officers, legislators, defendants, and plaintiffs. This course will explore the law’s social, political, cultural, and historical aspects. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine how social theorists conceptualize and explain the relationship between law and society. Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system. The course will advance students’ capacity to think critically and communicate effectively about themes, concepts, and arguments surrounding the law and learn what law is; where it comes from; who creates it; and what roles it plays in shaping society.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility"}

529	STSH	4700	Environmental Law	This is an introduction to environmental law and policy, with emphasis on the practical use and application of legal concepts. Students will work to develop critical thinking and advocacy skills. Professionals who work with environmental issues need to effectively argue for a position. Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA). Assigned readings for the guest speakers will replace those on the syllabus for that day. Depending on student progress and interests, the readings may change.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{Sustainability}

808	STSH	2300	Environment and Society	Society and the natural environment are crucially linked in a number of ways. Environmental problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society, affecting the way people live their lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of social organization and social practices. In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Environmental Futures"}

810	STSH	4320	Resilience Planning	What does resilience really mean and why does it matter? This course will unpack the multiple meanings that make up “resilience” and students will learn about its relevance to this society. Upon entering the Anthropocene, climate change will ensure that sporadic, disruptive change will be the norm. Disruptions will come on numerous levels and at a variety of scales. Is resilience about strengthening defenses so that “resilient” landscapes, infrastructure, and organizations can bounce back or is it more? Students will be asked to contribute to a collective understanding of how systems thinking and resilience thinking can help strengthen the ability to adapt and transform when humans are faced with social and ecological change. Can resilience planning help with the difficult conversations that are needed to balance the socio-economic and ecological trade-offs that the Anthropocene demands?	0	0	0	1	0	0	{"Environmental Futures"}

In this course, students will unpack the multiple meanings that make up “resilience” and learn about its relevance to human society. Upon entering the Anthropocene, climate change will ensure that sporadic, disruptive change will be the norm.  Disruptions will come on numerous levels and at a variety of scales. Is resilience about strengthening defenses so that “resilient” landscapes, infrastructure and organizations can bounce back, or is it more? Students will be asked to contribute to a collective understanding of how systems thinking and resilience thinking can help strengthen the ability to adapt and transform when humans are faced with social and ecological change. Can resilience planning help with the difficult conversations that are needed to balance the socio-economic and ecological trade-offs that the Anthropocene demands?	0	0	0	1	0	0	{Sustainability}

Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA).

Environmental problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society, affecting the way people live their lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of social organization and social practices. In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Environmental Futures"}

Upon entering the Anthropocene, climate change will ensure that sporadic, disruptive change will be the norm. Disruptions will come on numerous levels and at a variety of scales. Is resilience about strengthening defenses so that “resilient” landscapes, infrastructure, and organizations can bounce back or is it more? Students will be asked to contribute to a collective understanding of how systems thinking and resilience thinking can help strengthen the ability to adapt and transform when humans are faced with social and ecological change. Can resilience planning help with the difficult conversations that are needed to balance the socio-economic and ecological trade-offs that the Anthropocene demands?	0	0	0	1	0	0	{"Environmental Futures"}

From psychologists of reasoning and decision-making to behavioral economists to the “new atheists” (all groups whose message we will consider in this class), the onslaught is firmly underway, and fierce.	1	0	0	1	0	0	{Philosophy}

Law is more than the written word, the “black letter law.” People make the law—judges, attorneys, police officers, legislators, defendants, and plaintiffs. This course will explore the law’s social, political, cultural, and historical aspects. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine how social theorists conceptualize and explain the relationship between law and society. Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system. The course will advance students’ capacity to think critically and communicate effectively about themes, concepts, and arguments surrounding the law and learn what law is; where it comes from; who creates it; and what roles it plays in shaping society.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Science, Technology, and Society"}

Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA).
