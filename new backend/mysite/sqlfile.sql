142	STSH	2300	Environment and Society	Society and the natural environment are crucially linked in a number of ways. Environmental problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society, affecting the way people live their lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of social organization and social practices. In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures","Environmental Futures"}

153	STSS	2700	Law and Society	There ought to be a law…”  Law shapes people’s lives in countless ways; it is everywhere. Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimizes, protects, and prosecutes. Law is more than the written word, the “black letter law.” People make the law—judges, attorneys, police officers, legislators, defendants, and plaintiffs. This course will explore the law’s social, political, cultural, and historical aspects. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine how social theorists conceptualize and explain the relationship between law and society. Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system. The course will advance students’ capacity to think critically and communicate effectively about themes, concepts, and arguments surrounding the law and learn what law is; where it comes from; who creates it; and what roles it plays in shaping society.	0	0	0	0	1	0	{"Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society","Ethics, Integrity, and Social Responsibility","Science, Technology, and Society"}

65	STSH	4290	Sustainability by Design	Sustainability by Design will center around student-led project-based research, with a focus on getting to know one’s own specific potential, leveraging personal connections to communities, and making a difference in larger systems that can often seem intractable. Students will learn how to think and act within whole systems and design solutions that identify and push on leverage points in these systems. This process will bring analysis and design together in a multitude of ways, and the course can be thought of as a hybrid seminar/studio course, where students will learn about many design principles and practices and apply these lessons in practice, forming feedback loops between theory and action. At their best, students will transform systems from a degenerative state, to a sustainable one, and beyond to achieve regenerative systems.	0	0	0	1	0	0	{"Creative Design and Innovation","Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures","Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability,"Creative Design and Innovation","Environmental Futures",Sustainability}
289	STSS	4320	Resilience Planning	What does resilience really mean and why does it matter? In this course, students will unpack the multiple meanings that make up “resilience” and learn about its relevance to human society. Upon entering the Anthropocene, climate change will ensure that sporadic, disruptive change will be the norm.  Disruptions will come on numerous levels and at a variety of scales. Is resilience about strengthening defenses so that “resilient” landscapes, infrastructure and organizations can bounce back, or is it more? Students will be asked to contribute to a collective understanding of how systems thinking and resilience thinking can help strengthen the ability to adapt and transform when humans are faced with social and ecological change. Can resilience planning help with the difficult conversations that are needed to balance the socio-economic and ecological trade-offs that the Anthropocene demands?	0	0	0	1	0	0	{Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability,Sustainability}
268	PHIL	2400	Philosophy of Biology	This course addresses such issues as: Are species real entities in the world or just human constructs? Are biological phenomena reducible to physical processes or do irreducible biological features exist? What is the relationship between microevolution and macroevolution? Does sociobiology have something to contribute to understanding of ethics? To what extent are the structures of the human mind products of evolution?	0	0	0	1	1	0	{Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science",Philosophy,"Thinking with Science"}
