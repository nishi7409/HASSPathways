IHSS,1140,Minds and Machines,"This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Students meet in small sections to have class discussions and debates about questions like: What are minds? Are minds physical or non-physical? Do humans have free will? Does reliance on technology turn humans into cyborgs? How close are humans to building an intelligent robot or machine? Do we want this to be a goal? Students will learn how make a philosophical argument, and how to express them in writing or through an oral presentation.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence is quickly becoming pervasive in our lives.

IHSS,1235,Are Humans Rational?,"The Aristotelian dictum that we are rational animals is under severe attack these days. In fact, the previous sentence may seriously understate the situation: the dictum is perhaps outright rejected by many, if not most. From psychologists of reasoning and decision-making to behavioral economists to the “new atheists” (all groups whose message we will consider in this class), the onslaught is firmly underway, and fierce",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence is quickly becoming pervasive in our lives.

COGS,4410,Programming for Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence,"Research in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driven by data. Researchers in these fields collect, manipulate, model and analyze data generated by real-world processes.  Since the amount of data available has grown exponentially, the ability to automate these tasks through computer programs is essential. Specifically, probabilistic and statistical computing are needed to learn from the data. The objectives of this course are for the student to perform exploratory data analysis and to acquire the basics of statistical and machine learning in order to model real-world datasets.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence is quickly becoming pervasive in our lives.

IHSS,1080,History of Jazz and Improv Music,"The question of “what is jazz” remains a lively and contentious discussion to this day. This course charts the emergence, evolution, and influence of jazz music, as well as the many controversial musical, social, and philosophical questions it continues to provoke. The work of influential figures in American and European improvised music will be examined in detail, and the continuing development of jazz-inspired contemporary practices will be explored.
