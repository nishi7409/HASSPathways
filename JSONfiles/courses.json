Students meet in small sections to have class discussions and debates about questions like: What are minds? Are minds physical or non-physical? Do humans have free will? Does reliance on technology turn humans into cyborgs? How close are humans to building an intelligent robot or machine? Do we want this to be a goal? Students will learn how make a philosophical argument, and how to express them in writing or through an oral presentation.",

Students will work to develop critical thinking and advocacy skills. Professionals who work with environmental issues need to effectively argue for a position. Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA). Assigned readings for the guest speakers will replace those on the syllabus for that day. Depending on student progress and interests, the readings may change.",

The course moves on to investigate how language variation at those structural levels bleeds into social life \u2013 including the cultural and socio-historical production of identities, ideologies, and inequalities. The \u201cexercise\u201d component of this course provides a hands-on opportunity for engaging with the topics explored in course readings and lectures. Completing exercises will offer practice in, for example, using the International Phonetic Alphabet, transcribing and analyzing natural speech, and using various theoretical offerings to examine how social perspectives and attitudes impact both the use and interpretation of linguistic forms.",
